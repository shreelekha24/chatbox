# ChatBox Link Sharing Guide

## üîó How to Share ChatBox Links with Others

Your ChatBox application now supports sharing links with external users! Here's how to properly share links for different scenarios.

## üè† **Local Network Sharing (Same WiFi/LAN)**

### **For users on the same network (family, office, same WiFi):**

1. **Get your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
   
   # Mac/Linux
   ifconfig | grep "inet "
   ```

2. **Share the link format:**
   ```
   http://YOUR_IP:3000/room/ROOM_ID
   
   Example: http://192.168.29.91:3000/room/8D59F95F
   ```

3. **Users can join by:**
   - Opening the link in their browser
   - Or going to `http://192.168.29.91:3000` and entering the Room ID

### **‚úÖ What works:**
- ‚úÖ Same WiFi network
- ‚úÖ Same office network
- ‚úÖ Home network (different devices)
- ‚úÖ Video and voice calls
- ‚úÖ All real-time features

## üåê **Internet Sharing (External Users)**

### **For users outside your network (friends, remote work):**

You have several options:

### **Option 1: Port Forwarding (Advanced)**
1. **Configure your router** to forward port 3000 to your computer
2. **Get your public IP** from `whatismyipaddress.com`
3. **Share the link:**
   ```
   http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000/room/ROOM_ID
   ```

### **Option 2: Use a Tunnel Service (Recommended)**
1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Create a tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Share the ngrok URL:**
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok.io/room/ROOM_ID
   ```

### **Option 3: Deploy to Cloud (Best for Production)**
Deploy to services like:
- **Heroku**
- **Vercel**
- **Railway**
- **DigitalOcean**
